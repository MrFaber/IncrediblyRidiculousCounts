# Incredibly Ridiculous Counts v1.0 Open Beta
IRC is a new 1.12.2 Minecraft Modpack Project, which aims to be a kitchensink modpack with the temperament of a skyblock. It's as customized and as individual as a one-man-project can get.

FEATURES:
Questing: Small chained, consistent and challenging Questline with almost absurd item-demands to complete (e.g. 150k Cobble) (implemented via FTBQuests)

EMC integration done right: A less overpowered and minimal invasive ProjectE implementation with respect to the core mechanics… without nerfed emc values or without substituitive EMC Mods. 

Bring the Mine back in Minecraft: Less ores spawn in worldgen, you won’t be overwhelmed by ten different ores every five blocks. COFH World controls much of the Ore Gen, providing a balanced experience which aims at the moment of making you happy if you find ores. Additionally, a few custom features like geodes and fractals have been added. 

Make Villages great again: Sparse villages with ridicolous distance in between

Make Forestry Beehives great again: Rare beehive spawns with a bit more distance in between

Mod variability: a few brillant insider mods from the depths of curseforge, most people have never noticed

Mod reliability: many of the best mods for Minecraft 1.12.2 in their final and most error free versions. The modpack is high load but also highly reliable. Optifine recommended though.

Small Server economy: ItemShop with physical currency(coins) and virtual currency(FTBMoney). Many possibilities for Quest automation via FTBQuests.

Ambience&Animations: New Animations and Ambience mods for smooth & immersive surroundings

Fixed Monster AI and additional Mob effects for a better fighting experience than vanilla.

The modpack will be provided via Curseforge.
